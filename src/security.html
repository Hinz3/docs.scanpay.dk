  Security is very important to us. If you have any security concerns or issues, please disclose this information directly to <a href="mailto:security@scanpay.dk">security@scanpay.dk</a>. Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been handled by the security team.

<h2 id="basic-authentication">Basic authentication</h2>
<p>
  We support Basic authentication with API keys as credentials. All your API requests must include an authorization header with your base64-encoded API key. Like this:

  <code class="pcode"><span class="hljs-string">"Authorization: Basic "</span> + <span class="hljs-built_in">base64_encode(</span>apikey<span class="hljs-built_in">)</span></code>
</p>

<h2 id="x-signature">X-Signature</h2>
<p>
  The x-signature HTTP header is a base64 encoded HMAC-SHA2-256 signature of the body signed with your API key. You should always validate this signature.
</p>

<h2 id="transport-layer-security">Transport Layer Security</h2>
<p>
  For security reasons, we only support Transport Layer Security version 1.2 (TLSv1.2).

  use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), SHA-2 certificates.

   Below is a list of ciphers we can currently guarantee support for.
